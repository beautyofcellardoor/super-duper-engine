Project Logo: I have absolutely no artistic skills so this is my logo for now, but will most definitely be changed.

Description: I am going to make a match-three, Bejeweled clone game but instead of using jewels, I will be using animals for the objects the player is trying to match. Same as Bejeweled I am going to try to do an 8x8-grid space for the game. On the side, I will have a score, a timer, and a button to go back to the menu. The game will play like any other match-three game, and depending on how much time I have, I may also implement a hint button and an end game if there are no more possible moves. If I still have more time after that, I can add different game modes like puzzles, a timed mode, and having to get a target amount of points in under a certain amount of moves. 

Technologies: Qt, QML

Screenshots: Currently, I have no actual screenshots of anything I have done so these are all screenshots of other games.

I have yet to think of a name for my game, but my menu will look something similar to this game, Cogs. There will, hopefully, be numerous game modes to choose from and then a “How to Play”, an “Options” and an “Exit”. I do not think I will add achievements.

This is a screenshot from Bejeweled 2. On the left side where it has points and a couple of buttons is also where I would like to put my points, timer, and buttons. There’s a bar at the bottom of the screen that fills with the more points the player gets which I may add. And then the play grid. I will also include the equivalent of creating sparkly gems in my game. 

Installation:
~Install Qt 5.6
~Open the project
~Clean all, run qmake, build all, run

Contribution Guidelines: If someone wanted to add something to this project it could be any of the before mentioned things that I said I would add if there was time.

I don’t have a standard set up yet but I think I will be using camelcase for naming variables.

Bugs: I have not started, so there are currently no bugs.

To-Do List:

•	Make menu

•	Set up a timer, the button to go back to the menu, and an outline for play grid

•	Create a basic version of what the game will look like
